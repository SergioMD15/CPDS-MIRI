/* Time-Out Client server */

At state 3 there is a potential deadlock because we can only enter in the state but never exit it.
We have to rewrite SERVER to avoid this potential error.

/* write your solution */

CLIENT = (call -> WAIT),
WAIT = (answer -> continue -> CLIENT | timeout -> CLIENT).

SERVER = (request -> service -> reply -> SERVER | request -> timeout -> SERVER).

||CLIENT_SERVER = (CLIENT || SERVER) /{call/request, answer/reply}.

/* end homework */
